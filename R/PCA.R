#' Perform PCA on a coin
#'
#' Performs Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on a specified data set and subset of indicators or aggregation groups.
#' This function has two main outputs: the output(s) of [stats::prcomp()], and optionally the weights resulting from
#' the PCA. Therefore it can be used as an analysis tool and/or a weighting tool. For the weighting aspect, please
#' see the details below.
#'
#' PCA must be approached with care and an understanding of what is going on. First, let's consider the PCA excluding
#' the weighting component. PCA takes a set of data consisting of variables (indicators) and observations. It then
#' rotates the coordinate system such that in the new coordinate system, the first axis (called the first principal
#' component (PC)) aligns with the direction of maximum variance of the data set. The amount of variance explained by the
#' first PC, and by the next several PCs, can help to understand whether the data can be explained by simpler set of
#' variables. PCA is often used for dimensionality reduction in modelling, for example.
#'
#' In the context of composite indicators, PCA can be used first as an analysis tool. We can check for example, within
#' an aggregation group, can the indicators mostly be explained by one PC? If so, this gives a little extra justification
#' to aggregating the indicators because the information lost in aggregation will be less. We can also check this over
#' the entire set of indicators.
#'
#' The complications are in a composite indicator, the indicators are grouped and arranged into a hierarchy. This means
#' that when performing a PCA, we have to decide which level to perform it at, and which groupings to use, if any. The [get_PCA()]
#' function, using the `by_groups` argument, allows to automatically apply PCA by group if this is required.
#'
#' The output of [get_PCA()] is a PCA object for each of the groups specified, which can then be examined using existing
#' tools in R, see `vignette("analysis")`.
#'
#' The other output of [get_PCA()] is a set of "PCA weights" if the `weights_to` argument is specified. Here we also need
#' to say some words of caution. First, what constitutes "PCA weights" in composite indicators is not very well-defined.
#' In COINr, a simple option is adopted. That is, the loadings of the first principal component are taken as the weights.
#' The logic here is that these loadings should maximise the explained variance - the implication being that if we use
#' these as weights in an aggregation, we should maximise the explained variance and hence the information passed from
#' the indicators to the aggregate value. This is a nice property in a composite indicator, where one of the aims is to
#' represent many indicators by single composite. See \doi{10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105208} for a
#' discussion on this.
#'
#' But. The weights that result from PCA have a number of downsides. First, they can often include negative weights
#' which can be hard to justify. Also PCA may arbitrarily flip the axes (since from a variance point of view the
#' direction is not important). In the quest for maximum variance, PCA will also weight the strongest-correlating
#' indicators the highest, which means that other indicators may be neglected. In short, it often results in a very
#' unbalanced set of weights. Moreover, PCA can only be performed on one level at a time.
#'
#' All these considerations point to the fact: while PCA as an analysis tool is well-established, please use PCA weights
#' with care and understanding of what is going on.
#'
#' This function replaces the now-defunct `getPCA()` from COINr < v1.0.
#'
#' @param coin A coin
#' @param dset The name of the data set in `.$Data` to use.
#' @param iCodes An optional character vector of indicator codes to subset the indicator data, passed to [get_data()]
#' @param Level The aggregation level to take indicator data from. Integer from 1 (indicator level)
#' to N (top aggregation level, typically the index).
#' @param by_groups If `TRUE` (default), performs PCA inside each aggregation group inside the specified level. If `FALSE`,
#' performs a single PCA over all indicators/aggregates in the specified level.
#' @param nowarnings If `FALSE` (default), will give warnings where missing data are found. Set to `TRUE` to suppress these warnings.
#' @param out2 If the input is a coin object, this controls where to send the output. If `"coin"`, it
#' sends the results to the coin object, otherwise if `"list"`, outputs to a separate list (default).
#' @param weights_to A string to name the resulting set of weights. If this is specified, and `out2 = "coin"`,
#' will write a new set of "PCA weights" to the `.$Meta$Weights` list. This is experimental - see details. If
#' `NULL`, does not write any weights (default).
