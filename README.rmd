COINr is a high-level R package which is the first fully-flexible development and analysis environment for composite indicators and scoreboards. The main features can be summarised as features for *building*, features for *analysis* and features for *visualisation and presentation*.

**Building features**:

* Flexible and fast development of composite indicators with no limits on aggregation levels, numbers of indicators, highly flexible set of methodological choices.
* Denomination by other indicators (including built in world denominators data set)
* Screening units by data requirements
* Imputation of missing data, by a variety of methods
* Data treatment using Winsorisation and nonlinear transformations
* Normalisation by more than ten methods, either for all indicators or for each individually
* Weighting using either manual weighting, PCA weights or correlation optimised weights.
* Aggregation of indicators using a variety of methods which can be different for each aggregation level.

**Analysis features:**

* Detailed indicator statistics, and data availability within aggregation groups
* Multivariate analysis, including quick functions for PCA, and a detailed correlation analysis and visualisation
* Easy "what if" analysis - very quickly checking the effects of adding and removing indicators, changing weights, methodological variations
* Full global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis which can check the impacts of uncertainties in weighting and many methodological choices

**Visualisation and presentation:**

* Statistical plots of indicators - histograms, violin plots, dot plots, scatter plots and more
* Bar charts, stacked bar charts and tables for presenting indicator data and making comparisons between units
* Correlation plots for visualising correlations between indicators and between aggregation levels

COINr also allows fast import from the [COIN Tool](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/composite-indicators/coin-tool_en) and fast export to Excel.

In short, COINr aims to allow composite indicators to be developed and prototyped very quickly and in a structured fashion. As of v1.0 it has support for panel data.

## Installation

COINr is on CRAN and can be installed by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install released version from CRAN
install.packages("COINr")
```

The development version, which may be slightly more up-to-date, can be installed from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("bluefoxr/COINr")
```

This should directly install the package from Github, without any other steps. You may be asked to update packages. This might not be strictly necessary, so you can also try skipping this step.

## Getting started

COINr needs a little reading and learning to understand properly. But once you have done that, it can be very powerful for developing composite indicators.

A good place to get started is COINr's "Overview" vignette. Try `vignette("overview")`.

The most thorough documentation is available at [COINr's website](https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINr/) (developed using pkgdown). This contains all package documentation in an easy-to-navigate format. All documentation available here is also available by browsing COINr vignettes: see `vignette(package = "COINr")`.

## Recent updates

COINr has been recently updated to v1.0, skipping a few version numbers. This has brought in many new features, some discarded features, less dependencies and more robust underlying code. The syntax has also been changed to make the package more consistent. See `vignette("v1")` to learn about these changes if you were using COINr prior to v1.0.

COINr documentation was previously contained in an [online book](https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINrDoc/). This is still available, and although the principles of composite indicators there are still all valid, the code refers strictly to COINr < v.1.0.

If you prefer to roll back to the old COINr, you can still install it as a separate package called "COINr6". This is available on GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("bluefoxr/COINr6")
```
