\value{
A ggplot2 plot object

\description{
Plots the hierarchical indicator framework. If \code{type = "sunburst"} (default), the framework is plotted as a
sunburst plot. If \code{type = "stack"} it is plotted as a linear stack. In both cases, the size of each component
is reflected by its weight and the weight of its parent, i.e. its "effective weight" in the framework.
}
\details{
The colouring of the plot is defined to some extent by the \code{colour_level} argument. This should be specified
as an integer between 1 and the highest level in the framework (i.e. the maximum of the \code{iMeta$Level} column).
Levels higher than and including \code{colour_level} are coloured with individual colours from the standard colour
palette. Any levels \emph{below} \code{colour_level} are coloured with the same colours as their parents, to emphasise
that they belong to the same group, and also to avoid repeating the colour palette. Levels below \code{colour_level}
can be additionally differentiated by setting \code{transparency = TRUE} which will apply increasing transparency
to lower levels.

This function returns a ggplot2 class object. If you want more control over the appearance of the plot, pass
return the output of this function to a variable, and manipulate this further with ggplot2 commands to e.g.
change colour palette, individual colours, add titles, etc.
See \verb{vignette("visualisation}) for more details on plotting.

This function replaces the now-defunct \code{plotframework()} from COINr < v1.0.

# build example coin
coin <- build_example_coin(up_to = "new_coin", quietly = TRUE)

# plot framework as sunburst, colouring at level 2 upwards
plot_framework(coin, colour_level = 2, transparency = TRUE)
