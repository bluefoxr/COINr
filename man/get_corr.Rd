\arguments{
\item{coin}{A coin class coin object}

\item{dset}{The name of the data set to apply the function to, which should be accessible in \code{.$Data}.}

\item{iCodes}{An optional list of character vectors where the first entry specifies the indicator/aggregate
codes to correlate against the second entry (also a specification of indicator/aggregate codes). If this is specified as a character vector
it will coerced to the first entry of a list, i.e. \code{list(iCodes)}.}

\item{Levels}{The aggregation levels to take the two groups of indicators from. See \code{\link[=get_data]{get_data()}} for details.
Defaults to indicator level.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to \code{\link[=get_data]{get_data()}} (\code{uCodes} and \code{use_group}).}

\item{cortype}{The type of correlation to calculate, either \code{"pearson"}, \code{"spearman"}, or \code{"kendall"}.}

\item{pval}{The significance level for including correlations. Correlations with \eqn{p > pval} will be returned as \code{NA}.
Default 0.05. Set to 0 to disable this.}

\item{withparent}{If \code{TRUE}, and \code{aglev[1] != aglev[2]}, will only return correlations of each row with its parent. Alternatively, if
\code{withparent = "family"}, will return correlations with parents, grandparents etc, up to the highest level. In both cases the data set
must be aggregated for this to work.}

\item{grouplev}{The aggregation level to group correlations by if \code{aglev[1] == aglev[2]}. Requires that
\code{make_long = TRUE}.}

\item{make_long}{Logical: if \code{TRUE}, returns correlations in long format (default), else if \code{FALSE}
returns in wide format. Note that if wide format is requested, features specified by \code{grouplev}
and \code{withparent} are not supported.}
}
\value{
A data frame of pairwise correlation values in wide or long format (see \code{make_long}).
Correlations with \eqn{p > pval} will be returned as \code{NA}.
}
\description{
Helper function for getting correlations between indicators and aggregates. This retrieves subsets of correlation
matrices between different aggregation levels, in different formats. By default, it will return a
long-form data frame, unless \code{make_long = FALSE}. By default, any correlations with a p-value less than 0.05 are
replaced with \code{NA}. See \code{pval} argument to adjust this.
}
\details{
This function allows you to obtain correlations between any subset of indicators or aggregates, from
any data set present in a coin. Indicator selection is performed using \code{\link[=get_data]{get_data()}}. Two different
indicator sets can be correlated against each other by specifying \code{iCodes} and \code{Levels} as vectors.

The correlation type can be specified by the \code{cortype} argument, which is passed to \code{\link[stats:cor]{stats::cor()}}.

The \code{withparent} argument will optionally only return correlations which correspond to the structure
of the index. For example, if \code{Levels = c(1,2)} (i.e. we wish to correlate indicators from Level 1 with
aggregates from Level 2), and we set \code{withparent = TRUE}, only the correlations between each indicator
and its parent group will be returned (not correlations between indicators and other aggregates to which
it does not belong). This can be useful to check whether correlations of an indicator/aggregate with
any of its parent groups exceeds or falls below thresholds.

Similarly, the \code{grouplev} argument can be used to restrict correlations to within groups corresponding
to the index structure. Setting e.g. \code{grouplev = 2} will only return correlations within the groups
defined at Level 2.

The \code{grouplev} and \code{withparent} options are disabled if \code{make_long = FALSE}.

Note that this function can only call correlations within the same data set (i.e. only one data set in \code{.$Data}).

This function replaces the now-defunct \code{getCorr()} from COINr < v1.0.
