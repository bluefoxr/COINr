\item{combine_treat}{By default, if \code{f1} fails to pass \code{f_pass}, then \code{f2} is applied to the original \code{x},

of \code{f1}, so the two treatments will be combined.}

A treated vector of data.

\description{
Operates a two-stage data treatment process, based on two data treatment functions, and a pass/fail
function which detects outliers. This function is set up to allow any functions to be passed as the
data treatment functions (\code{f1} and \code{f2}), as well as any function to be passed as the outlier detection
function \code{f_pass}.
}
\details{
The arrangement of this function is inspired by a fairly standard data treatment process applied to
indicators, which consists of checking skew and kurtosis, then if the criteria are not met, applying
Winsorisation up to a specified limit. Then if Winsorisation still does not bring skew and kurtosis
within limits, applying a nonlinear transformation such as log or Box-Cox.

This function generalises this process by using the following general steps:
\enumerate{
\item Check if variable passes or fails using \code{f_pass}
\item If \code{f_pass} returns \code{FALSE}, apply \code{f1}, else return \code{x} unmodified
\item Check again using *\code{f_pass}
\item If \code{f_pass} still returns \code{FALSE}, apply \code{f2} (by default to the original \code{x}, see \code{combine_treat}
parameter)
\item Return the modified \code{x} as well as other information.
}

For the "typical" case described above \code{f1} is a Winsorisation function, \code{f2} is a nonlinear transformation
and \code{f_pass} is a skew and kurtosis check. Parameters can be passed to each of these three functions in
a named list, for example to specify a maximum number of points to Winsorise, or Box-Cox parameters, or anything
else. The constraints are that:
\itemize{
\item All of \code{f1}, \code{f2} and \code{f_pass} must follow the format \verb{function(x, f_para)}, where \code{x} is a
numerical vector, and \code{f_para} is a list of other function parameters to be passed to the function, which
is specified by \code{f1_para} for \code{f1} and similarly for the other functions. If the function has no parameters
other than \code{x}, then \code{f_para} can be omitted.
\item \code{f1} and \code{f2} should return either a list with \code{.$x} as the modified numerical vector, and any other information
to be attached to the list, OR, simply \code{x} as the only output.
\item \code{f_pass} must return a logical value, where \code{TRUE} indicates that the \code{x} passes the criteria (and
therefore doesn't need any (more) treatment), and \code{FALSE} means that it fails to meet the criteria.
